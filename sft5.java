// Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code you've provided. The code is written in Java and it defines a class named sft5 with a main method. The main method is the entry point of a Java application.

// Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

// Two integer variables a and b are declared and initialized with values 8 and 21, respectively.
// The bitwise left shift operator << is used to shift the bits of variable a three places to the left. This operation multiplies the value of a by 2^3 (or 8). The result is then added to the value obtained by shifting the bits of variable b three places to the right using the bitwise right shift operator >>. This operation divides the value of b by 2^3 (or 8). The result of this addition is assigned to variable b.
// The values of variables a and b are concatenated and printed to the console using the System.out.println() method.
// So, if you run this code, it will print the values of a and b after performing the bitwise operations on them. The output will be 8136.

// I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
